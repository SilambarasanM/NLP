Evaluation of Earley Parser:
----------------------------
Evaluate the parser in its current form:
>>> What sorts of sentences can it parse? <<<

SENTENCE: she was driving a jetcar to chicago
POSSIBLE PARSES:
S[ NP[ FPRON[she] ] VP[ VBAR[ VBAR[ FAUX[was] FV[driving] ] NP[ FD[a] NBAR[ FN[jetcar] ] ] ] VBAR-MODS[ PP[ FP[to] NP[ FNAME[chicago] ] ] ] ] ]
S[ NP[ FPRON[she] ] VP[ VBAR[ VBAR[ FAUX[was] FV[driving] ] NP[ FD[a] NBAR[ FN[jetcar] NBAR-MODS[ PP[ FP[to] FNAME[chicago] ] ] ] ] ]
S[ NP[ FPRON[she] ] VP[ VBAR[ VBAR[ FAUX[was] FV[driving] ] NP[ FD[a] NBAR[ FN[jetcar] ] PP[ FP[to] NP[ FNAME[chicago] ] ] ] ]

SENTENCE: did he drive from chicago
POSSIBLE PARSES:
S [ FAUX [ did ] NP [ FPRON [ he ]  ] VP [ VBAR [ FV [ drive ]  ] VBAR-MODS [ PP [ FP [ from ] NP [ FNAME [ chicago ]  ]  ]  ]  ]  ] 

SENTENCE: they will give the watermelons to john
POSSIBLE PARSES:
S[ NP[ FPRON[they] ] VP[ VBAR[ VBAR[ FAUX[will] FV[give] ] NP[ FD[the] NBAR[ FN[watermelons] ] ] PP[ FP[to] FNAME[john] ] ] ] ]
S[ NP[ FPRON[they] ] VP[ VBAR[ VBAR[ FAUX[will] FV[give] ] NP[ FD[the] NBAR[ FN[watermelons] ] ] ] VBAR-MODS[ PP[ FP[to] FNAME[john] ] ] ] ]





>>> What types of sentences will it fail to parse? <<<

SENTENCE: john lives on this planet
CAUSE OF FAILURE:  Grammar did not include a determiner as a part of prepositional phrase. Only pp recognizable is pp -> fp np.

SENTENCE: he gives a jetcar to steal the watermelon
CAUSE OF FAILURE: infinitives are not recognized by the grammar.

SENTENCES: i will have to drive a jetcar / i will be driving to chicago
CAUSE OF FAILURE: have/be words not included in grammar

SENTENCE: she and i will drive to chicago
CAUSE OF FAILURE: conjuctions not included in grammar

SENTENCE: give this car
CAUSE OF FAILURE: There are no sentences that start with a verb in the given grammar.

SENTENCE: i give and live
CAUSE OF FAILURE: conjuctions not included in grammar

SENTENCE: he lives in chicago so they will give him a jetcar
CAUSE OF FAILURE: conjuctions not included in grammar





>>> What improvements are required for the failed sentences? <<<

Addition of Productions to the grammar will improvise the performance of the parser.

For example, 

PRODUCTION ADDED	|		SENTENCE PARSED
----------------	|		---------------
					|
NP -> NP FCNJ NP	|		she and i will drive to chicago
FCNJ -> and			|
					|
VP -> VP FCNJ VP	|		I give and live
FCNJ -> and			|
					|
S -> S FCNJ S		|		he lives in chicago so they will give a jetcar
FCNJ -> so			|
					|
NBAR -> FNAME		|		john lives on this planet
